This is a collection of solutions to various coding challenges from Hackerrank.com.

The purpose of this project is to allow prospective employers to get a sense for my coding/algorithm skills.

I will be adding solutions to this project, as time permits.  There are currently solutions to the
 following two challenges:
 
 - [Arrays: left rotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=arrays)
